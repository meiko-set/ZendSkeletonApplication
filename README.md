# ZendSkeletonApplication

## Introduction

This is a skeleton application using the Zend Framework MVC layer and module
systems. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those
looking to get their feet wet with Zend Framework.

It is forked from zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication, so you will find some additional documentation there.
